# CheckTree - Read Me

One of the feature parities between Ext JS' modern and classic toolkits in 6.5 is the lack of check functionality that classic's tree has. This package is meant to solve this with a simple override and some SASS.

## Usage

Download this package into your app's `packages/local` directory and run an `sencha app watch` to pick up the override and SASS. This is the only step to install this.
